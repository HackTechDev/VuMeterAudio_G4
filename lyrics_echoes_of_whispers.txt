[Verse]
In the shadows where we used to hide
Whispers linger of our last goodbye
Footsteps echo in the empty hall
Silent memories on every wall

[Verse]
Faded photographs on dusty frames
Old love letters signed with only names
Candles burning down to melted wax
Every heartbeat seems to play it back

[Chorus]
You were the ghost I couldn't hold tight
Vanished dreams in the silent night
In the mist of morning's soft embrace
I still search for traces of your face

[Bridge]
Lost in the echoes of what we shared
Wandering through what we never dared
Falling leaves like the tears we cried
In the twilight where love once lied

[Verse]
Clock ticks louder in this lonely room
Every second mourning our doomed bloom
Winds of sorrow through the windows blow
Whispering secrets of all we know

[Chorus]
You were the ghost I couldn't hold tight
Vanished dreams in the silent night
In the mist of morning's soft embrace
I still search for traces of your face
